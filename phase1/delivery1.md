### Project’s idea description

LUNI aims to be the end all be all platform for library related activities in FEUP.

As students of the university, when we were confronted with the challenge to design an app directed at FEUP students necessities several ideas came to mind. One of the first discussed topics amongst the group were the parking lots, an idea quickly surfaced of creating some way for students and staff to be able to quickly decide where to park their car and help them find a spot. Thereafter an idea for a platform uniting FEUP's cantine and its 2 bars was discussed, the goal was to gather up all of the information on available menus, items, prices and even ordering food in a single place so that the community had a clean and accessible way to plan lunches around campus. However both of these ideas fell flat, as both of them seemed too simple and, as a group, we did not see ourselves using our very own products, that's when the LUNI project started to gain its form.

LUNI is a mobile and web application gathering all of the information and activities necessary to efficiently and comfortably use all of the library's resources. It gives users real time information about occupancy of rooms as well as individual sitting spots in the many library's floors and tables, this functionality aims to help visiting students find a comfortable place to sit without having to search each and every floor of the building, which is not only exhausting but might also disturb other students. Another key feature of LUNI is its emphasis on prioritizing the user's needs above all else, as such not only does it offer the opportunity to check on book availability and make reservations it also selects books according to the users currently attending units, however the commitement to spreading awareness for the benefits of consulting books doesn't stop there as there is also an online shop for them. However, and as we will discuss further on, there are more facets of the space that are many times forgotten mainly its events, in an effort to spread more awareness about them and deliver more news related to activities ocurring in FEUP, there will also be a page advertising ongoing events and other library specific announcements.

### Related apps/services/systems

When analyzing the currently available market of library related apps we did not find any that truly took this topic in the same vein that we are trying to, therefore we took as our guidelines and competitors 2 closely related systems with FEUP's library. The first one being the library's very own website, an obvious choice for this project's theme and goals, and UNI, a student developed mobile application which already gathers several of the university's most important services.

- FEUP's library website: a simple website for the SDI services.
    - Pros: 
        - Access to a very big database filled with resources provided directly by the uni;
    - Cons:
        - Outdated interface which is hard for new users to get to grips with;
        - Lack of real-time information, mainly the number of vacant places;
        - Difficulty in finding physically available books and papers;
- UNI: an app developed by NIAEFEUP with the goal of providing easy mobile access to some of FEUP's services.
    - Pros:
        - Very big userbase within FEUP;
        - Already uniting multiple facets of the services necessary for the students in a single place;
    - Cons:
        - Sometimes inconsistent interface among its multiple pages;

### Questionnaire

After leaving the questionnaire open for answers for about 1 week, and sharing it within group chats and asking for answers in person, a total of 17 people responded to the Google Forms.

The demography that was consulted was pretty homogenic, consisting of, in its majority, of male students all of which with ages ranging between 19 and 20 and attending the 3rd year bachelor's from the L.EIC/M.EIC course. We are aware how this may skew our general perception of our real userbase that would encompass the entirety of FEUP's community, especially taking into account the small sample size.

When questioned about their personal experiences with the library's services the replies revealed that there were several different type of habits. Whilst it's almost unanimous that the services are acessible and that the most common activity in the library was studying and using the computers, the frequency of attendence to the library was not so straight forward. About one third on enquirees using the library sporadicaly a few times during a month, while another third visits it once a week and only a quarter never attend it, with the remainder 1 answer claiming to use it multiple times per week.
Events proved to be absent from all of the answerers visits of the library with most of them pointing out a lack of interest and a lack of awareness to these events as the causes of not attending them.
Still in this section we were able to understand that the majority of the people did not read or consult the literature required by their units as it didn't seem necessary or there were other formats not available in the library (video, websites, ...).

Inquiring about the functionalities that we had planned and other platforms the data revealed that users are the most happy while using UNI, are content with Moodle and clearly do not like using Sigarra. For the minority of user's that knew about the library's website, their experience with the website was negative. As for the relevance of the features that were planned, answers revealed a big interest in the availabilty of books as well as seats, whilst upcoming events proved to be not as relevant as expected.

With these results we are able to more accurately organize our efforts in order to attend to what, at least, some of our potential users may want to see in this project. More precisely, the small number of answers that highlighted the library's events as a core part of the its usage, as a student, have given us a greenlight to focus our attention on some other needs of the community, however our commitment to bringing these events to the attention of more students has not ended, while it will take a backseat in our priorities, the large number of answers that cited a "lack of knowledge" about said events has reinforced the idea that the lack of participation and knowledge about them may not necessarily stem from disinterest but rather a lack of awareness within the community's spaces. Furthermore, we will place special importance in the pages related to the library's spaces and its in person usability. Taking a closer look at the implications related to the design and usability of the developing product, we must lean more into the pratical and simple design philosphy demonstrated in UNI, which was signifficantly more popular than our chosen competitors, whilst trying to implement all of the rich content features present in the library's website that many are unaware of.

### 11 Questions

1. Who are the users?

This application will targets all of FEUP's students, despite our questionnaire having had an admittely skewed demography we are able to recognize, not only as developers but also as fellow students, the necessity for this kind of services.

2. What tasks do they perform?

Currently, the library is used mainly as a study place. A smaller sample of answers revealed that there is some usage of the library's computers.

3. What tasks are desirable?

Our main focus will be in the book domain, search and purchase of books, and the space domain, viewing and reserving seats.We also aim to have filters for these features and that the users are comfortable and have quick access to them. We will also give students the opportunity to consult and register in events.

4. How are tasks learned?

Tasks are learned through repeated use of the application and are also inherited from previous knowledge, something that we expect given the simplicity of the app.

5. Where are tasks performed?

They may be performed in any one of these digital mediums: computer, mobile phone or tablet.

6. What is the relationship between user and information?

Users must share some of their Sigarra information with the app, information that will not be shared with other users. Although there is still sensitive information in the app related to purchases users showed they were comfortable with digital payment methods.

7. What other instruments does the user have?

Users are still able to visit the library in person, being able to talk to its staff, or consult the library's website.

8. How do users communicate?

Users do not communicate within LUNI, therefore we did not analyze this concern.

9.  How often tasks are performed?

We expect that the most common tasks are the ones related to the use of the library space, mainly reserving and searching seats, followed up by book domain's activities. Events were shown to not be as relevant as expected.

10.   Are there time restrictions?

While LUNI must be fast and responsive it is not time sensitive. However it should be noted that while actions may be performed at any time of the day, there are still restrictions that do apply, being that they are tied to the regular functioning hours of the library.

11.   What happens if something goes wrong?

Failure of the system is not critical, while it might be undesirable, users may always visit the library in person.

### Personas

In order to create a profile of our potential userbase we created 3 personifications of people with goals that encompassed the ones highlighted on the questionnaire and some of the teams' goals for users that use this application. From this, 3 personas were born, Ellis, "The Out of Town Student", Lucas, "The First Job", and Maria, "The New Learner".

![Lucas Mendes](UX%20Persona%20-%20Lucas%20Mendes.png)
![Maria Joana](UX%20Persona-%20Maria%20Joanapng.png)

### Simplified conceptual model

Stripping down all of the UI ideas that were flowing through the team discussion we were able to build the followin conceptual model, which allows us to get a better feel for what users, in essence, will be able to do in LUNI.

- Objects (attributes)
    - User (name, photo, courses)
    - Book (title, cover, summary, status, courses, sellable, price);
    - Seat (location, status); 
    - Location (floor, characteristics);
    - Events (date, title, description, registration fee, capacity)
- Actions 
    - Consult book status;
    - Reserve, buy books; 
    - Recommend, get recommendation;
    - Find available seat and book it;
    - See events;
    - Register in event;
- Relations 
    - Book has associated status;
    - Books on sale have price;
    - User is enrolled in courses;
    - Books have courses associated;
    - User have book recommendations;
    - Seat has location;
    - Rooms are a group of seats;
    - Location has characteristics;
    - Users can register in multiple events;

### Activity scenarios

There were 3 activity scenarios made, one for each persona, based not only on their respectives descriptions but also on feedback from the aforementioned questionnaire. The first scenario follows Ellis and their groups' struggles to finish a project, the second one stars Lucas as he must find a book for one of his course units', which he is able to accomplish using Luni, and lastly Maria plans to meet new people and engage more with FEUP's activities through the library, with the aid of our app.

Ellis has just returned from a weekend with their family in Lisbon. For the past 2 days Ellis had been going around their home city visiting their extended family and hanging out with their girlfriend, for what was certainly for her not enough time.
Upon returning to Porto and to her accomodation in the city Ellis is struck with the realization that an upcoming delivery has been brought forward a couple days and their work has just been thrown completely off schedule. With this in mind they contact their friends from their group who are also unaware of the occurance and quickly try to hatch a plan to be able to deliver everything they must on time. However as this plan requires a few physical deliverables to be made the group can't simply hop on an online call and work away.
Ellis quickly searches on their computer for LUNI's page and navigates to the "Availability" section. There they are able to check on the currently occupied rooms and tables as well as check on a prevision of the changes in occupancy in the upcoming hours. Upon figuring out that their favorite room is available they quickly book it for a time period in that afternoon and let the rest of their group know about it from within LUNI's interface. They are then able to meet up, finish up their project in a comfortable environment and even have some time left to hang out afterwards, which always helps Ellis cooldown from a very busy weekend and day.

After getting off of work for the day Lucas notices a new notification on his phone, the page for one of his units in this semester has just been updated and the year's group chat is going nuts with it! The professor has declared that the previously suplementary reading has now become mandatory and that pratical lessons shall be replaced by its reading. With little time to react to the news and determined to not fail the unit Lucas has no other choice but to get his hands on a copy of the book as soon as possible. While reading the messages that are flying around on his phone, he remembers that the library might have the book in its shelfs or maybe even for sale.
Lucas opens up the LUNI app and is greated by several recommendations to his enrolled units bibliography, as he prepares to start searching the book within the database he notices it sits directly on his home screen. He is then able to confirm that is indeed the correct book for the class and immediately checks its availability, which unfortunately reveals to him that the book is currently not available, but that there are more copies on their way. Lucas quickly orders one of the copies feeling comfortable that is billing data is secured in the app and selects the option for an in person pick up of his order. He then goes back to the group chat to advise his colleagues on what he had just done, and gloat a little about his quick thinking.

It is wednesday morning and without any plans for the afternoon and wanting to be involved in some activities in the university Maria is asking her friends if they have any plans for the day. Whilst most of them have some sort of family issue to take care of one of her more distant friends, Mariana, points out that a book sharing event going on in the library. Maria sees this as an opportunity to develop her bond and takes up Mariana on her idea, who seemed pretty weary to share it in the first place.
They both reach for their mobile phones and check LUNI's event tab, where they immediately find highlighted that day's events. After reading some more about the event and even pondering on attending another one in a different university, they are able to quickly register themselves and are set for that afternoon. Maria and Mariana spend a great afternoon together talking about their favourite books, music and getting to know eachother better, by the end a strong bond has been formed. 

### Functionalities and tasks

The following are some functionalities with their respective tasks associated, we aim to give a better understanding of our idea for a user interactions with the application in this way, it helps us convey the how our ideas come to life in the user's hands and needs.

|Functionalities | Tasks|     
|-----|-----|
|Search for a seat| Search for an available seat with computer access on the third floor|
|Buy a book| Buy a book from a course I'm enrolled that has a price below 20€|
|Regist in an event| Register in the spelling contest that will take place next week|

### Usability requirements

For each domain of activties that we have planned for LUNI we have created some requirements to fulfill its usability by a metric that we feel comfortable that the users experience without any gripes or major issues, divising this notion in 3 realms of efficacy, "How well?", efficiency, "How fast/much effort?", and satisfaction, "How comfortable?". The scenarios present an example of what one might expect when accomplishing a task in one of each of the domains that are present in LUNI, the first one in the space domain, followed up by the books domain and the third one the events domain. 

#### Search for an available seat with computer access on the third floor

|||
|-----------|----------|
|Efficacy| 80% of the users reached an available seat in their first try|
|Efficiency| Average time of finding a seat with that criteria below 1 minute <br> Selecting third floor and computer access in 4 or less clicks|
|Satisfaction| Less than 15% of users unsatisfied with map display|

#### Buy a book from a course I'm enrolled that has a price below 20€

|||
|-----------|----------|
|Efficacy| If the book is available, all the users tasks should have a success rate of 96% or above|

|Satisfaction| 95% of the users should consider the registration process to be pratical|

### Conclusion

These efforts have revealed that we are on the right track to build an app that feels needed and wanted by FEUP's community. Our initial goal of bringing a more welcoming way of interacting with the library digitally has been reassured, not only by the answers of the questionnaire but also our further investigation of this very issue. However we are still mindful of some of the possible shortcomings of our project, mainly in the issues related to events.

It's important to stay aware that this is an initial procedure that does not account for the specifics of the aesthetics and UI elements of the application, it simply focuses on the building blocks that are important when tackling these other issues.
