### Projectâ€™s idea description

LUNI aims to be the end all be all platform for library related activities in FEUP.
As students of the university, when we were confronted with the challenge to design an app directed at FEUP students necessities several ideas came to mind. One of the first discussed topics amongst the group were the parking lots, an idea quickly surfaced of creating some way for students and staff to be able to quickly decide where to park their car and help them find a spot. Thereafter an idea for a platform uniting FEUP's cantine and its 2 bars was discussed, the goal was to gather up all of the information on available menus, items, prices and even ordering food in a single place so that the community had a clean and accessible way to plan lunches around campus. However both of these ideas fell flat, as both of them seemed too simple and, as a group, we did not see ourselves using our very own products, that's when the LUNI project started to gain its form.

LUNI is a mobile and web application gathering all of the information and activities necessary to efficiently and comfortably use all of the library's resources. It gives users real time information about occupancy of rooms as well as individual sitting spots in the many library's floors and tables, this functionality aims to help visiting students find a comfortable place to sit without having to search each and every floor of the building, which is not only exhausting but might also disturb other students. Another key feature of LUNI is its emphasis on prioritizing the user's needs above all else, as such not only does it offer the opportunity to check on book availability and make reservations it also selects books according to the users currently attending units, however the commitement to spreading awareness for the benefits of consulting books doesn't stop there as there is also an online shop for them. However, and as we will discuss further on, there are more facets of the space that are many times forgotten mainly its events, in an effort to spread more awareness about them and deliver more news related to activities ocurring in FEUP, there will also be a page advertising ongoing events and other library specific announcements.

    - Pros: 
        - Access to a very big database filled with resources provided directly by the uni;
    - Cons:
        - Outdated interface which is hard for new users to get to grips with;
        - Lack of real-time information, mainly the number of vacant places;
        - Difficulty in finding physically available books and papers;
- UNI: an app developed by NIAEFEUP with the goal of providing easy mobile access to some of FEUP's services.
    - Pros:
        - Very big userbase within FEUP;
        - Already uniting multiple facets of the services necessary for the students in a single place;
    - Cons:
        - Sometimes inconsistent interface among its multiple pages;

### Questionnaire

After leaving the questionnaire open for answers for about 1 week, and sharing it within group chats and asking for answers in person, a total of 17 people responded to the Google Forms.

With a characteristic demography consiting in its majority of male (76.5% male, 17.6% female, 5.9% nonbinary) students, all of which with ages between 19 and 20 and with a majority of 3rd year bachelor's (82.4% 3rd yearbachelor's, 11.8% 1st year master's, 5.9% 2nd year bachelor's), mostly from the L.EIC/M.EIC course (94,1% L.EIC/M.EIM, 5.9% L.EQ/M.EQ).

When questioned about their personal experiences with the library's services the replies revealed that there were several different type of habits. Whilst it's almost unanimous that the services are acessible and that the most common activity in the library was studying and using the computers, the frequency of attendence to the library was not so straight forward. About one third on enquirees using the library sporadicaly a few times during a month, while another third visits it once a week and only a quarter never attend it, with the remainder 1 answer claiming to use it multiple times per week.
Events proved to be absent from all of the answerers visits of the library with most of them pointing out a lack of interest and a lack of awareness to these events as the causes of not attending them.
Still in this section we were able to understand that the majority of the people did not read or consult the literature required by their units as it didn't seem necessary or there were other formats not available in the library (video, websites, ...).

Inquiring about the functionalities that we had planned and other platforms the data revealed that users are the most happy while using UNI, are content with Moodle and clearly do not like using Sigarra. For the minority of user's that knew about the library's website, their experience with the website was negative.
As for the relevance of the features that were planned, answers revealed a big interest in the availabilty of books as well as seats, whilst upcoming events proved to be not as relevant as expected.

### Activity scenarios

Ellis has just returned from a weekend with their family in Lisbon. For the past 2 days Ellis had been going around their home city visiting their extended family and hanging out with their girlfriend, for what was certainly for her not enough time.
Upon returning to Porto and to her accomodation in the city Ellis is struck with the realization that an upcoming delivery has been brought forward a couple days and their work has just been thrown completely off schedule. With this in mind they contact their friends from their group who are also unaware of the occurance and quickly try to hatch a plan to be able to deliver everything they must on time. However as this plan requires a few physical deliverables to be made the group can't simply hop on an online call and work away.
Ellis quickly searches on their computer for LUNI's page and navigates to the "Availability" section. There they are able to check on the currently occupied rooms and tables as well as check on a prevision of the changes in occupancy in the upcoming hours. Upon figuring out that their favorite room is available they quickly book it for a time period in that afternoon and let the rest of their group know about it from within LUNI's interface. They are then able to meet up, finish up their project in a comfortable environment and even have some time left to hang out afterwards, which always helps Ellis cooldown from a very busy weekend and day.

After getting off of work for the day Lucas notices a new notification on his phone, the page for one of his units in this semester has just been updated and the year's group chat is going nuts with it! The professor has declared that the previously suplementary reading has now become mandatory and that pratical lessons shall be replaced by its reading. With little time to react to the news and determined to not fail the unit Lucas has no other choice but to get his hands on a copy of the book as soon as possible. While reading the messages that are flying around on his phone, he remembers that the library might have the book in its shelfs or maybe even for sale.
Lucas opens up the LUNI app and is greated by several recommendations to his enrolled units bibliography, as he prepares to start searching the book within the database he notices it sits directly on his home screen. He is then able to confirm that is indeed the correct book for the class and immediately checks its availability, which unfortunately reveals to him that the book is currently not available, but that there are more copies on their way. Lucas quickly orders one of the copies feeling comfortable that is billing data is secured in the app and selects the option for an in person pick up of his order. He then goes back to the group chat to advise his colleagues on what he had just done, and gloat a little about his quick thinking.

It is wednesday morning and without any plans for the afternoon and wanting to be involved in some activities in the university Maria is asking her friends if they have any plans for the day. Whilst most of them have some sort of family issue to take care of one of her more distant friends, Mariana, points out that a book sharing event going on in the library. Maria sees this as an opportunity to develop her bond and takes up Mariana on her idea, who seemed pretty weary to share it in the first place.
They both reach for their mobile phones and check LUNI's event tab, where they immediately find highlighted that day's events. After reading some more about the event and even pondering on attending another one in a different university, they are able to quickly register themselves and are set for that afternoon. Maria and Mariana spend a great afternoon together talking about their favourite books, music and getting to know eachother better, by the end a strong bond has been formed.
