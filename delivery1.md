### Related apps/services/systems

- FEUP's library website: a simple website for the SDI services.
    - Pros: 
        - Access to a very big database filled with resources provided directly by the uni;
    - Cons:
        - Outdated interface which is hard for new users to get to grips with;
        - Lack of real-time information, mainly the number of vacant places;
        - Difficulty in finding physically available books and papers;
- UNI: an app developed by NIAEFEUP with the goal of providing easy mobile access to some of FEUP's services.
    - Pros:
        - Very big userbase within FEUP;
        - Already uniting multiple facets of the services necessary for the students in a single place;
    - Cons:
        - Sometimes inconsistent interface among its multiple pages;

### Questionnaire

After leaving the questionnaire open for answers for about 1 week, and sharing it within group chats and asking for answers in person, a total of 17 people responded to the Google Forms.

With a characteristic demography consiting in its majority of male (76.5% male, 17.6% female, 5.9% nonbinary) students, all of which with ages between 19 and 20 and with a majority of 3rd year bachelor's (82.4% 3rd yearbachelor's, 11.8% 1st year master's, 5.9% 2nd year bachelor's), mostly from the L.EIC/M.EIC course (94,1% L.EIC/M.EIM, 5.9% L.EQ/M.EQ).

When questioned about their personal experiences with the library's services the replies revealed that there were several different type of habits. Whilst it's almost unanimous that the services are acessible and that the most common activity in the library was studying and using the computers, the frequency of attendence to the library was not so straight forward. About one third on enquirees using the library sporadicaly a few times during a month, while another third visits it once a week and only a quarter never attend it, with the remainder 1 answer claiming to use it multiple times per week.
Events proved to be absent from all of the answerers visits of the library with most of them pointing out a lack of interest and a lack of awareness to these events as the causes of not attending them.
Still in this section we were able to understand that the majority of the people did not read or consult the literature required by their units as it didn't seem necessary or there were other formats not available in the library (video, websites, ...).

Inquiring about the functionalities that we had planned and other platforms the data revealed that users are the most happy while using UNI, are content with Moodle and clearly do not like using Sigarra. For the minority of user's that knew about the library's website, their experience with the website was negative.
As for the relevance of the features that were planned, answers revealed a big interest in the availabilty of books as well as seats, whilst upcoming events proved to be not as relevant as expected.
