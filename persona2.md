### Narrative/Lifestyle/Behavioural patterns 

After studying for 4 years Lucas has finally struck a job opportunity and intends to hold it with his whole might. Getting here however was not easy and he went through many hardships right from the start, in his first year of university he was held back due to medical complications he could not have forseen. After recovering in the hospital for the better part of a year Mendes returned to his studies and gave it his all, unfortunately a security vulnerability in the universities mobile payment method meant he lost 300€ to a scammer, being refunded only recently. Now with new goals and a job to cater to Lucas won't take "no" for an answer and will try his hardest to overcome the hardships he faced in the past years and finally finish his degree and establish himself as a valuable and integral part of his work team!

### Objective/Needs

- Being that time is limited as he has to juggle both his job and his education, Lucas needs to be aware of available studying spots at a moments' notice.
- Given his past unfortunate experiences with online transactions, he must feel comfortable and confident about his information on the app.
- Without much time to adapt and comfortably use his computer, Lucas must have access to the app on his phone.

### Frustratiuons/Pain points

- As Lucas' experience with technology is quite limited and not pleasant he might feel frustrated to have to use an application instead of simply asking for information in person, whether to classmates or faculty workers.
- He is frustrated with his situation and stagnation when compared to his peers, this fact makes him easily irritable, which in tandem with his already impatience grants him a short fuse in stressful or time sensitive situations.
